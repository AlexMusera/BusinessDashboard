This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app --typescript`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Next.JS KPI Business Dashboard

A Next.JS boilerplate with the famous Open Source Boostrap Admin Template, [CoreUI](https://coreui.io/).

This dashboard is built with `Typescript` and [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), using the App Router.

## Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/AlexMusera/BusinessDashboard.git

Set up the application while on the directory that contains package.json and install the depedencies by running.

npm install    


Then, run the development server:

npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## My Thought process.

I checked through all the requirements about the dashboard. I wanted to complete the UI part the the backend part using the Mock Api. I hhave mocked the data locally on src/localles/en/lang.json. I started by using the already existed Open source bootstrap admin  Template [CoreUI](https://coreui.io/). I was able to customise it and  implement responsive both on web and mobile applications. I was able to implement darkmode but not using the Chakra Ui theme as stated. The last part with I wanted to complete was to test with larger datasets to check on its perfomance.

## Challenges faced.

Because of limited time which I had to learn some things I had to prioritize on the deliverables. I also faced integrating the opensource bootstrap with Nextjs but I had to read and check some code on github.

## Future improvements.

Working on real Json data. Large realtime datasets and completing all tasks.
